# University Assignment Feedback Autogenerator
Program written in Python3 to auto-generate feedback for assignments in .pdf format to be uploaded to VLE platforms.

### Background
If you are an academic who has to grade students' assignment and upload the feedback into VLE or student feedback platform like FASER then you are already aware of the painful process of generating individual feedback in .pdf format. This program will automatically pull the marks from an excel worksheet (.xls) and generate .pdf feedback file that can be uploaded easily. Please refer to Installation-doc.pdf and CEXXX-Assignment1-feedback.xls files to check for example marks to run the program. If you have hundreds of students in the course and prefer marking them in excel sheet then this program is a huge time-saver. Enjoy!
